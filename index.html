              Hello! My name is Matthew. Before learning to code I was an
              Instructor at the University of Virginia, and a scientist at a
              Biotechnology company. I have always loved learning how complex
              things work, hence the PhD, but at the same time I have always had
              a drive to build something useful with that knowledge and
              understanding. For the past decade I have been doing that in the
              field of molecular genetics. Diving deep into the published
              literature, carrying out experiments in the laboratory, and data
              analysis at my desk. I was even given the opportunity to teach
              university students - something that I will probably always enjoy
              doing, though these days my lessons would probably be in computer
              programming.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast-forward to today, and you will find me building my skills in
              the Javascript-stack, building websites, apps, and features as I
              finish up a 6-month software development bootcamp. I absolutely
              love this new field of coding. It brings me so much joy to bring a
              simple idea from a rough sketch on paper to a full-featured
              application, as does the community of fellow developers that I
              have met up until this point. I sometimes wonder how software
              development eluded me for all these years, while I was pursuing a
              career elsewhere, being just so engaging and creative, but I
              suppose I am here now. Look below, for some of the technologies I
              have been working with recently.
